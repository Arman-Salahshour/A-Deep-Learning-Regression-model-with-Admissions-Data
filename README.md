# Just-For-Fun with Deep-Learning (Part 1)
### Just-For-Fun with Deep-Learning is a series that teaches how to develop a deep learning model from scratch. You should read the comments carefully because they contain a lot of information. This series will be updated with new neural network models and various datasets. 
### Hopefully, you will find it enjoyable âœŒ
### Have fun coding ðŸ˜Š


# About the project
For this project, we will create a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).
By analyzing the parameters in this graduate admissions dataset, we will use TensorFlow with Keras to create a regression model that can evaluate the chances of an applicant being admitted.
